### Introduction

The SCAPv2 Prototype project is an effort to create an open-source prototype implementation of the SCAPv2 data collection architecture. This project has two main goals:

* To experiment and validate designs before codified in an architecture standard
* To work towards providing an example implementation in order to support the future testing of compliant vendor products.

The project supports dummy message flows through the architecture, in support of key use cases.

### What is SCAP?

The [Security Content Automation Protocol](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/security-content-automation-protocol) (SCAP) is a super-standard that is publshed by NIST ([NIST SP 800-126](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-126/rev-3/final)), comprised of a number of referenced component standards maintained by NIST as well as other groups. The primary use cases of SCAP surround automated enterprise security assessment, vulnerability and patch management, configuration assessment, and software inventory.

### What is SCAPv2?

[SCAPv2](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/security-content-automation-protocol-v2) is an effort that began in late 2018 to create the next  major iteration of the SCAP standard, in support of several key goals:

* To support continuous monitoring of enterprise assets, rather than just-in-time
* To expand the SCAP focus to all enterprise assets including cloud, mobile, IoT etc, rather than only focusong on traditional endpoints
* To standardize interoperable architectural components, rather than just be a data format standard

Development on the SCAPv2 standard itself occurs in several [open public working groups](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/security-content-automation-protocol-v2/scapv2-community).
